/*
 * We use two nested flex layouts:
 * the outer one contains just the navbar and the main content,
 * to ensure that the main content is the only thing that grows to take up screen space,
 * and the inner one contains the diff, iframe, and buttons,
 * and instructs the iframe to grow to take up screen space
 * (or to shrink as less space is available: diff and buttons are more important).
 * Effectively, this means thereâ€™s no scrolling on the page except inside the iframe,
 * and the buttons are always at the bottom of the page.
